## FIGARO: fast intuitive genome annotation browsing

### ABSTRACT
Summary: FIGARO is a highly intuitive application for quickly searching genome reference and annotation tracks from multiple databases, previewing selected tracks, and generating genome browser views from a desktop or tablet web browser. The web application can be pointed to one or more instances of our genome annotation database, which comes packaged in a pre-configured virtual machine with a run-once batch file import tool. Our application simplifies and streamlines the user experience for the vast majority of genome browser use cases.
